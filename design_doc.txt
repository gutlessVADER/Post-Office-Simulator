Semaphores:

0	ArrayList done	- makes a semaphore for every customer to indicate their completion status
10	capacity		- makes sure only ten customers are inside the post office
3	servicing		- controls number of customers able to be helped at once
0	ready			- lets worker know customer is ready
1	FirstMutex		- protects global variable access
0	ThirdMutex		- ensures customer requests assistance at appropriate time
0	request			- forces customer to request service before worker can begin working
1	scales			- ensures only one worker can use the scales at a time
0	working			- determines whether a worker is currently helping a customer

Pseudocode:

	Postal Worker
	
		wait(ready)
		read global variables
		signal(ThirdMutex)
		wait(request)
		
		if mailing a package
			wait(scales)
			sleep for task
		else
			sleep for task
		
		signal(done(customer))
		signal(working)
		signal(servicing)
	
	Customer
	
		wait(capacity)
		wait(servicing)
		wait(FirstMutex)
		
		read global variables
		
		signal(ThirdMutex)
		
		signal(request)
		signal(FirstMutex)
		
		wait(done(customer))
		signal(working)
		signal(capacity)
