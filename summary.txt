Project 2 Summary

	My project uses three Java classes; PostOfficeSimulation, PostalWorker, and Customer.
PostOfficeSimulation all of the semaphores, customers and workers, and has a method for
determining how long a thread should sleep based on its current task. PostalWorker contains
the run method that simulates a postal worker, and customer works in a similar vein.
	Most of the difficulties I encountered with this project involved making sure postal
workers and customers would say things in the correct order, and print the correct numbers.
I learned a lot about how to manage multiple semaphores, and by the end, implementing the
scale was relatively easy.
	The end result is a very stable and efficient post office simulator, which I am very
proud of. It prints things in the correct order every time, and properly joins threads
when they are finished. It also ensures mutual exclusion across several areas.
